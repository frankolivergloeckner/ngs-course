Short tutorial on how to install the BioLinux Virtualbox image for the course. All kudos for Grazia Quero and Gian Marco Luna.

## Install Virtualbox
1. Download VirtualBox. VirtualBox from Oracle is freely available at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. Make sure that you download the correct version for your operating system.

2. Install the VirtualBox program. If you are using Windows, double-click the setup file and follow the prompts to install. If you are using a Mac, open the DMG file that you downloaded and drag the VirtualBox file to your Applications folder
```
During the Windows installation, keep all of the options set to their default.
```

3. Start the program. VirtualBox allows you to manage your various virtual machines, and easily create new ones. You can run VirtualBox directly from the installation program, or you can start it from the desktop icon.

## Importing OVA file to Virtualbox
1. After downloading your “qiime.ova” file, open Virtualbox, to go to “File -> Import Appliance” in the menu bar.

3. The next window will show you the configuration of the current virtual appliance. You can scroll through the configuration list and double click on any item (or check/uncheck the box) to make changes to it. Finally, click “Import”.

Virtualbox will proceed to import the virtual machine into your library. Depending on the size of your OVA file, the import process could take a while. Once the process is completed, you should be able to see the new VM in your list.
